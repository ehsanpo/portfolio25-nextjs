He had a contagious enthusiasm and took responsibility for the overall wellbeing of the team, never hesitating to knock on one’s shoulder to discuss an issue or offering help or support.

Besides his excellent ability to break down tasks and problems and provide high quality code to efficiently solve even the most demanding task we have had, Ehsan also has the ability to convey the essence of a problem and explain both the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ it should be solved to junior devs as well as customers alike. But working with Ehsan is also challenging in the best possible way. He is always on the lookout for new tech and ideas, on how to do things better. This is something from which everyone in our team has benefitted from. Over a great many cups of tea, we have discussed how to approach problems, potential pitfalls and best practices. I’m sure that Ehsan’s knowledge, curiosity and sense of teamwork will be a great asset to any organisation and I envy the next developer who gets to pick his brain. - It’s always time for tea…"

Working with Ehsan means constantly being introduced to new ideas and interesting innovations. It’s about being challenged (in a good way!) in your ways of thinking, to find creative and efficient solutions to complex problems, and being confident that the code your team produces will adhere to best practices. But above all, it’s an absolute blast. Ehsan possesses the ability to see the whole picture, which enables him to produce quality products – even if the brief is a bit fuzzy. He has an eagerness to share his expertise and has, on countless occasions, made both our team and our department better by doing so. He also has a keen eye for design, which has made my job as a designer so much easier. Replacing him in our team will be a struggle, and I do hope our professional paths cross again in the future.

      "desc": "Under vår tid som kolleger på Bredband2 har jag fått uppleva Ehsans kunskap i programmering och vilja att ligga i framkanten med ny teknik. Jag har haft äran att jobba tillsammans med Ehsan i både stora och små team och projekt. Han har en bra förmåga att snabbt sätta sig in i problemen som skall lösas och använda befintlig eller samla nya kunskaper för att lösa dessa. Vi har haft många bra stunder där vi har diskuterat programmering och problemlösning, nu senast i ett projekt involverat React och NextJS. Sammanfattningsvis anser jag Ehsan som en mycket skicklig och motiverad programmerare. Hans tekniska expertis, engagemang för självförbättring och anmärkningsvärda lagarbete gör dem till en oumbärlig medlem i alla organisationer. Jag tvivlar inte på att Ehsan kommer att fortsätta att ge betydande bidrag och nå stora framgångar i sina framtida ansträngningar. Skulle inte tveka att ha Ehsan som kollega igen i framtiden."

Väldigt omtyckt av sina kollegor och har mycket input att komma med när det gäller olika frågor runt webbutveckling och systemutveckling överlag. Jag kan rekommendera Ehsan till det mesta när det kommer till systemutveckling, både backend och frontend. Skulle det vara något han inte kan så kommer han lära sig snabbt. Och han är alltid välkommen tillbaka till oss på Bredband2 i framtiden!"

I had the pleasure of working with Ehsan in my two interships at the Guts & Glory, we collaborated on many projects. I was particularly impressed by Ehsan´s ability to handle even the toughest projects effortlessly. That skill often takes years to develop among developers professionals, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him. And I still miss working with him! As a team member or a leader, Ehsan earns my highest recommendation."

Hela projektet baserades på en (vid det tillfället) ej tillgänglig funktion på Facebook. Ehsan lyckades inte bara skapa denna funktion och därmed säkra hela leveransen, utan var även högst delaktig i att utforma hela den tekniska aspekten av projektet. Hårt slit under stor tidspress och obefintlig budget var inget hinder för Ehsan. Tack!"
