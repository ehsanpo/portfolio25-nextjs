<h2>Case Study: Fullstack Developer at Telavox</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>At Telavox, I work as a Fullstack Developer with a focus on front-end development. Our team is dedicated to building an Electron and web application for our softphone product, ensuring it meets the highest standards of performance and user experience.</p>

<h3>Project 1: Visual Refresh and RTL Support</h3>

<p>The primary goal of this project was to update the design of our application with a modern, sleek interface and to introduce Right-to-Left (RTL) support for the Arabic language. This involved a complete rewrite of the application in TypeScript, as well as addressing technical debt by migrating from MUI4 to Tailwind CSS.</p>

<h3>Key Responsibilities:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Collaborated closely with a multidisciplinary team of developers and UX designers.</li>
    <li>Guided the UX team to ensure component designs were practical and implementable.</li>
    <li>Rewrote the entire application in TypeScript to enhance maintainability and performance.</li>
    <li>Integrated Tailwind CSS to replace MUI4, simplifying the styling process and improving design consistency.</li>
    <li>Implemented RTL support to make the application accessible to Arabic-speaking users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Achievements:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Successfully delivered a modernized application interface that improved user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the application's maintainability and scalability by leveraging TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.</li>
    <li>Fostered a collaborative environment with the UX team, resulting in well-designed, user-friendly components.</li>
</ul>

### Project 2: **Next-Gen Video Conferencing Platform: Revolutionizing Virtual Collaboration** üöÄ

In today‚Äôs hyperconnected world, video conferencing has become the backbone of communication. I set out to develop a **next-gen video conferencing solution** that goes beyond basic video calls‚Äîdesigned for seamless collaboration, crystal-clear communication, and adaptability.

#### **Key Features** üåü

1. **Real-Time Chat** üí¨  
   A sleek, user-friendly chat interface enables instant text communication during calls, ensuring nothing is missed. Powered by modern web technologies for low-latency messaging.

2. **Adaptive Video Quality Optimization** üé•  
   Built for global connectivity, the platform dynamically adjusts video quality based on network conditions. This ensures a smooth experience even on low-bandwidth connections.

3. **AI-Powered Live Captions** ‚úçÔ∏è  
   Integrated with OpenAI models, this feature provides real-time, accurate captions to improve accessibility and inclusivity.

#### **The Tech Stack** üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend:**

  - **TailwindCSS:** For a sleek, responsive, and modern UI.
  - **TypeScript:** For strongly-typed, maintainable code.

- **Backend:**

  - **Mediasoup:** The powerhouse for WebRTC-based video conferencing. It enables ultra-low latency, scalability, and flexible topologies.
  - **Custom JS SDK:** Built to streamline communication between the frontend and backend.

- **AI Capabilities:**
  - OpenAI's language models power real-time captioning, offering accessibility and context-aware insights during meetings.

#### **Challenges & Solutions** üß©

1. **Latency Optimization:**  
   With Mediasoup, we implemented a selective forwarding unit (SFU) architecture, ensuring low latency for multi-participant calls.

2. **Seamless Video Quality Adjustments:**  
   Leveraging advanced WebRTC APIs, I built an adaptive mechanism that analyzes user bandwidth and adjusts video streams dynamically.

3. **AI Caption Accuracy:**  
   Integrated a custom preprocessing layer for better speaker segmentation and context recognition using OpenAI‚Äôs API.

#### **Why It Stands Out** üåê

This platform isn‚Äôt just another video conferencing app‚Äîit‚Äôs built to tackle the most common frustrations with virtual collaboration. By combining **cutting-edge WebRTC technology**, **AI-driven features**, and an intuitive design, it enhances productivity and brings people closer together, no matter where they are.
