# Design System Portfolio

A comprehensive, production-ready design system built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project showcases modern web development practices with beautiful glassmorphism effects, gradient animations, and a complete component library.

## Project Overview

This design system serves as both a functional component library and a portfolio showcase, demonstrating advanced frontend development skills and design principles. It features a complete set of reusable components, design tokens, and interactive demonstrations.

### Key Features

- **50+ Components** - Comprehensive component library with consistent styling
- **7 Color Palettes** - Semantic color system with accessibility in mind
- **Typography System** - Custom fonts (Basement, Kabel) with optimal readability
- **8px Spacing Grid** - Consistent spacing and layout system
- **Design Tokens** - Centralized design values for scalability

### Technical Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for performance
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design tokens
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

## Implementation Highlights

The system uses a sophisticated token-driven approach where all design values are centralized in `src/tokens/` and imported into the Tailwind configuration. This ensures consistency across all components and makes theme customization straightforward.

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Example: Button component with variant system
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?:
    | "primary"
    | "secondary"
    | "outline"
    | "ghost"
    | "gradient"
    | "glass";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
}
```

The component library follows a strict variant-based API design that ensures consistency while providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Results

- **Improved Development Speed** - Consistent components reduce development time
- **Design Consistency** - Token-driven approach ensures visual coherence
- **Accessibility First** - All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance Optimized** - Lightweight and fast-loading components

This project demonstrates the power of systematic design thinking combined with modern web technologies to create scalable, maintainable user interfaces.
