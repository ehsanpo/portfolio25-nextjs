# E-commerce Platform

## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform for a mid-sized retail company looking to expand their online presence. The platform needed to handle high traffic volumes, process payments securely, and provide an excellent user experience across all devices.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Query** for server state synchronization

### Backend

- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS** for cloud infrastructure

### Key Features

#### User Experience

- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for mobile users
- **Advanced search** with filters and faceted navigation
- **Real-time inventory** updates
- **Wishlist and favorites** functionality

#### E-commerce Features

- **Product catalog** with categories and variants
- **Shopping cart** with persistent state
- **Secure checkout** with multiple payment options
- **Order tracking** and history
- **Customer reviews** and ratings system

#### Admin Dashboard

- **Inventory management** with bulk operations
- **Order processing** and fulfillment tracking
- **Customer management** and support tools
- **Analytics dashboard** with sales metrics
- **Content management** for products and pages

## Implementation Highlights

### Performance Optimization

```typescript
// Implemented image optimization with lazy loading
const ProductImage = ({ src, alt, sizes }) => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      sizes={sizes}
      loading="lazy"
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
    />
  );
};

// Database query optimization with proper indexing
const getProducts = async (filters) => {
  return await db.query(
    `
    SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name,
           AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
    LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
    WHERE p.active = true
    ${filters.category ? "AND c.slug = $1" : ""}
    GROUP BY p.id, c.name
    ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
    LIMIT $2 OFFSET $3
  `,
    [filters.category, limit, offset]
  );
};
```

### Security Implementation

- **JWT authentication** with refresh token rotation
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **HTTPS enforcement** with proper headers
- **PCI compliance** for payment processing

### Payment Integration

```typescript
// Stripe payment processing with error handling
const processPayment = async (paymentIntent, orderData) => {
  try {
    const payment = await stripe.paymentIntents.confirm(paymentIntent.id);

    if (payment.status === "succeeded") {
      await createOrder(orderData);
      await updateInventory(orderData.items);
      await sendOrderConfirmation(orderData.customer);
      return { success: true, orderId: orderData.id };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    await logPaymentError(error, orderData);
    throw new PaymentError("Payment processing failed");
  }
};
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: High Traffic Handling

**Problem**: The platform needed to handle sudden traffic spikes during sales events.

**Solution**:

- Implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Used CDN for static assets
- Added database connection pooling
- Implemented horizontal scaling with load balancers

### Challenge 2: Inventory Synchronization

**Problem**: Keeping inventory accurate across multiple sales channels.

**Solution**:

- Built real-time inventory tracking system
- Implemented optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Added inventory reservation during checkout process
- Created automated reorder alerts

### Challenge 3: Search Performance

**Problem**: Product search was slow with large catalogs.

**Solution**:

- Integrated Elasticsearch for full-text search
- Implemented search suggestions and autocomplete
- Added faceted navigation for filtering
- Optimized database indexes for common queries

## Results & Impact

### Performance Metrics

- **Page load time**: Under 2 seconds on mobile
- **Conversion rate**: 3.2% (industry average: 2.1%)
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Transaction volume**: 10,000+ daily transactions

### Business Impact

- **Revenue increase**: 150% year-over-year growth
- **Customer satisfaction**: 4.7/5 star rating
- **Mobile sales**: 65% of total transactions
- **Return customers**: 40% repeat purchase rate

### Technical Achievements

- **Scalable architecture** supporting 100,000+ concurrent users
