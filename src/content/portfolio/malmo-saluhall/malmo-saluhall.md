 <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>
    With a new brand identity, Malmö Saluhall needed to update the digital profile of the website. As a developer at Gutsglory agency, I worked closely with Martin Johansson, the agency's art director, to build the website. The team collaborated to translate the new brand identity into a captivating digital UI. After completing the project, we provided support and maintenance for the site and implemented additional features. The successful outcome of the project was recognized when Malmö Saluhall was awarded Svenska Designpriset in the category of Digital Design.
